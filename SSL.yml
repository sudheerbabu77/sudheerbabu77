# SSL and TLS are the most crucial feature for running applications since which create the protection layer for apps 
# in Kubernetes there are a few ways to secure application with these key and certification with the help of ingress and secrets
 
#   $ kubectl create secret tls Node-demossl --namespace default --key node-dem.key --cert node-demo.crt          
   
#   $ kubectl get secrets 

# then
  
#    $ openssl req -newkey rsa:20148 -nodes -key Node-demo.key -out Node-demo.crt -subj "/CN=helloworldnodejs.com" 

# this command is used to generate the key and certificate for apps using cert manager of kubernetes 


#    $ ll -lrt (to know list of keys)

# the generated key is to be added to secrets 
# after this, we have to create ingress with tls and secrets
